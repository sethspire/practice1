    "> The variable `Foreign Gift Amount`is numerical. It has no missing values, but it does have 24 negative ones, which feels like mistakes in the data. Doing some research on this data set at the Federal Student Aid website (https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/topics/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-reporting/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-data#), it says, \"Any negative amounts reported in the spreadsheets indicate an institutionally reported adjustment to a previously reported amount.\" So those are correctly negative but have a different meaning as they are to fix previous data. The median is about $94k while the mean is about $588k so there must be a few very large values (like the max which is nearly $100 million) causing it to skew right."

This could also be used to model/predict future gifts as well.

Gifts may be so dependent on the exact needs of a time (for example, funding research for COVID-19 could have given universities a temporary increase that is not indicative of future giving). Ethically, university leadership groups would likely be using this to try and maximize their total gifts received, which means they coul choose to target certain countries or giftors which may bring about moral or ethical dilemmas based on who is giving the money (for example, just because UVA could get rich taking money from ISIS, they probably shouldn't).\n",
